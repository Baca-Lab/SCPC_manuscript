Transformation to squamous cell carcinoma is a rare resistance mechanism in patients with advanced prostate cancer that impacts both prognosis and treatment. Herein, we profile circulating chromatin in serial plasma samples collected from a patient with metastatic prostate cancer that experienced squamous transformation. We detect dynamic changes in gene regulation from circulating chromatin reflecting the emergence of squamous differentiation, enabling non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of this resistance phenotype.
The accompanying R markdown serves the calculation of epigenomic signals at sites of interest, including squamous-specific enhancers and AR binding sites, and generates plots illustrating the dynamics of these signals through time.
The raw sequencing data used in this study can be accessed via GEO under accession numbers GSE291318 (prostate cancer samples) and GSE243474 (healthy samples).
